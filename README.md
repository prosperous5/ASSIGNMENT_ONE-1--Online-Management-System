This project is an Online Library Management System built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++.
The system manages:
Books → Add, remove, search, borrow, return.
Users → Add users, track borrowed books.
Library → Central system that connects books and users.
It demonstrates encapsulation, modularity, and test-driven development.
